# MED2XLPY
This repository contains a WIP script to recreate an easier to use and platform independent version of MPC2XL which is both outdated and requires much manipulation on the end user. The goal of this project here is to result in an output Pandas dataframe or an excel file which can be easily manipulated for scripts later without requiring specific profiles. Additionally another benefit is that it handles multianimal files well. This project provides a potentially better alternative to other existing projects due to its lack of reliance on inputting any MPC experiment files, and requring little effort on the end user. 

# Installing
Currently there is no GUI and functions are wrapped to be used by a GUI later. You may be able to use the functions in your other scripts if you'd like for now however.
